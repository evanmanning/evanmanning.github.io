### Introduction

In the context of musical instruments such the piano, *fingering* is the choice of what fingers to use for certain notes in a musical score to enable a comfortable, technically sound performance of the score. The term may also refer to a transcription on the score that indicates using numbers or other symbols which fingers to use, and in this paper we will mainly use the term in this sense. Whether a fingering is used as a suggestion from a composer or editor to those who are learning to play a piece, or as a method for recording an individual performer’s own approach to playing a piece, it is a useful tool that facilitates accurate and consistent performance. Fingerings are also used for non-keyboard instruments such as the violin, but the present discussion will focus on fingering for keyboard instruments.

Determining and transcribing a fingering is time-consuming, and in some cases it may be difficult for an individual to determine the best fingering for a score. Thus, there is a motivation for developing a system to automatically generate plausible fingerings for scores. Systems for automatic fingering generation have been proposed, such as those by Kasimi et al. (2007) and Parncutt et al. (1997), but they have a number of limitations: First, many of them only address monophonic scores (scores where only one note is played at a time), whereas it is usual for real scores for keyboard instruments to be largely polyphonic. Second, although Kasimi et al. propose a system for polyphonic fingering, they mention the possibility of improvement by allowing for finger substitution (changing the finger that is holding down a key while a note is in progress).

In addition to improvements in these areas, we wish to address the problem of fingering for *legato* technique, which arises in particular with certain types of scores for organ. Playing with legato technique involves transitioning from note to note with no intervening silence, and is employed frequently in, for example, the accompaniment for four-part choral pieces such as hymns. Whereas a piano provides a pedal to lift the dampening pads from the strings to allow sound to continue after a key is pressed and released, thus providing a method to smoothly transition from one note to the next, organs operate quite differently: sound begins when a key is pressed and always ends when the key is released, meaning that releasing one key a significant time interval before the next key is pressed creates a period of intervening silence. Therefore, legato technique on organ presents a different fingering problem from on piano. On organ, in most cases the player cannot use the same finger to release one note and press the next, as this means releasing the first key a significant time interval before the next key is pressed. The player must instead use different fingers for successive notes to ensure that the second key can be pressed down at the exact moment when the previous key is released.

In this paper we propose a system for automatic generation of legato organ fingerings. We build on the previously proposed systems by generating fingerings for polyphonic scores, with the added constraints of legato technique, allowing for finger substitution as well as extensive crossing of fingers during note transitions.

### Algorithm

Kasimi et al. propose a method for generating polyphonic fingerings by representing candidate fingerings assignments for notes in the score as nodes in a trellis graph. Each column of nodes in the graph represents a point in time where at least one new note begins in the score, and in this paper we term such a point in time a *score state*. Each node in a score state column represents a candidate fingering assignment to the notes of the score state, and we term such an assignment a *fingering state*. Kasimi et al.’s approach calculates a difficulty cost for each individual fingering state, termed vertical cost, and for each transition from one fingering state to the next, termed *horizontal cost*. Each path from “start” to “end” in the graph represents a possible fingering sequence, and the least-cost path through the graph is calculated in order to determine the optimal fingering. This approach of modeling candidate fingering assignments as nodes in a graph is illustrated below in a figure from Kasimi et al.’s paper. The fingering states shown are for the right hand, and following the convention of music notation, the numbers 1 through 5 are used to indicate fingers, with 1 indicating the thumb and 5 indicating the little finger.

We use the same approach of representing candidate fingerings assignments as a graph. For each score state we generate fingering states by enumerating possible candidate fingerings, but in order to enable playing according to the constraints of legato technique as described above, our algorithm differs from those of previous authors. Instead of enumerating all possible fingering assignments for the notes of a score state, we enumerate the assignments that are possible using the fingers that were not used in the previous fingering state from which the current fingering state has transitioned. If fingers from the previous fingering state were to be used, it would necessitate lifting them in order to transition to the notes in the current score state, thus creating intervening silence between the notes and violating the constraints of legato technique. Thus, we avoid their use. However, we also allow for finger substitution as mentioned earlier, and the approach for this is described later in this section.

In order to compute horizontal and vertical costs, we require a model that indicates difficulty of assigning certain fingers to certain spans of keys on the keyboard. Parncutt et al. have reviewed prior research that collected data from musicians about the difficulty of fingering for various spans, and have constructed a model that associates pairs of fingers and spans with costs; this model is shown in the table below. As indicated, the unit used to measure spans is a semitone.

<img src="/images/cost-table.png" style="width: 700px"/>

The cost values shown in the body of the table have been computed using a number of rules described by the authors. For example, for the finger pair (1, 2), the costs for spans 1 through 5 are all equal to 0 because each of those spans are considered to be in the comfortable range for this finger pair. This basic overview of the association of finger pairs and spans with costs is sufficient for our present purpose; detailed information can be found by consulting the paper by Parncutt et al.

We calculate the vertical cost as follows. For a given fingering state, consisting of an assignment of fingers to the notes of the corresponding score state, we consider the adjacent pairs of fingers in the assignment. For example, in the fingering state represented by the diagram below, we consider the finger pairs (1, 2) and (2, 5). We find the span in semitones of the notes to which each finger pair is assigned, and look up the cost in the model for this finger pair and span. The vertical cost is the total of the costs of the finger pairs under consideration. In this example, (1, 2) is assigned to C4 and E4, having a span of 4 semitones, and (2, 5) is assigned to E4 and C5, having a span of 8 semitones. Thus, according to the model, the pair costs are 0 and 4, respectively. The vertical cost for this fingering state is 4, the total of the pair costs.

<img src="/images/vertical-cost.png" style="width: 250px"/>

In the case that a finger pair and span do not have an entry in the model table, the assignment is considered to be impractical or impossible, and we assign a cost of infinity. For efficiency, we do not include fingering states with a cost of infinity in the graph.

We calculate the horizontal cost as follows. Given two sequential fingering states in the graph, we consider the adjacent pairs of fingers that are formed by taking one finger from the first fingering state and one finger from the second fingering state. We remove from consideration any pairs where the pair and its corresponding notes are a duplicate of a pair found in either fingering state alone (since such a pair is accounted for by the vertical cost), as well as pairs where the note from the first and second fingering states is the same. For example, in the fingering state represented by the diagram below, we consider the pairs (1, 2), (1, 4), and (4, 5). Once the pairs are determined, the cost of each pair is determined according to the model in the same manner as for the vertical cost. The horizontal cost is then calculated as the average of the pair costs. In the example below, (1, 2) is assigned to C4 and B3, having a span of –1 semitones. The span is negative because the fingers cross each other, and the model contains entries for spans that involve crossing. The pair (1, 4) is assigned to C4 and D4, having a span of 2 semitones, and (4, 5) is assigned to D4 and E4, having a span of 2 semitones. Thus, according to the model, the pair costs are 2, 3, and 0, respectively. The horizontal cost for this fingering state transition is 1.66, the average of the pair costs.

<img src="/images/horizontal-cost.png" style="width: 375px"/>

In cases where normal transitions from one fingering state to the next are of particularly high cost, or where all such transitions are impossible, it may be beneficial to use *finger substitution*, wherein the player changes the finger that is used to play a particular note while the note is still in progress, thus making available the finger that was originally used to play the note. In order to account for all possible substitution transitions in the graph so that possible fingering sequences may include substitutions, we use the following approach. Between each pair of score states SS1 and SS2 in the score, we create an intermediate score state SS1′, which consists of the same notes as SS1. For each fingering state under SS1′ we make assignments such that at least one finger is different from the assignment in the fingering state from which it transitions, meaning that at least one finger is substituted. This graph construct is illustrated in the diagram below, with the substitution fingering state highlighted in yellow (for simplicity, not all possible fingering states are shown).

<img src="/images/substitution-graph.png" style="width: 600px"/>

As shown, this construct allows for possible fingering sequences that use substitution as well as those that do not. Vertical costs for substitution fingering states are calculated as described earlier. Horizontal costs for transitions to substitution fingering states, in which the notes for the source and destination fingering states are the same, are given a constant value of 3.0, which is intended to represent the relative difficulty of the movement and time required to perform substitution. Horizontal costs for transitions from substitution fingering states are calculated as described earlier.

Once the graph is constructed and the vertical and horizontal costs are calculated, we use Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the lowest-cost path from the start to the end. The sequence of fingering assignments corresponding to the lowest-cost path is output as the solution fingering for the input score.

### Results

We ran the algorithm on several short test scores to evaluate the results, and we include a few samples here The first score is an excerpt from “Hyfrydol,” a hymn tune, using the right-hand parts (soprano and alto). The generated fingering is shown above the score, with substitutions represented by hyphens.

```

To evaluate the generated fingering, we compare it with a reference fingering for the score produced by an organist. Although there are many approaches for evaluating a hypothesis against a reference fingering, we use a simple method the suits are present objective of obtaining a rough measure of accuracy. We count the number of assignments in the generated fingering that match with the assignment in the corresponding position in at least one of the reference fingerings (multiple reference fingerings may be supplied), and divide this by the total number of assignments in the generated fingering. This evaluation for the above score and fingering is represented below.

```
Score: 0.92

Trace:

Generated fingering:
(1, 3)  (2, 4)  (1,)    (1, 2)  (1, 3)  (1, 4)  (2, 4)  (1, 3)  (3, 5)S (2, 4)  (1, 3)  (2, 4)

Reference fingering 1:
(1, 3)  (2, 4)  (1,)    (1, 2)  (1, 3)  (1, 4)  (2, 4)  (1, 3)  (1, 5)S (2, 4)  (1, 3)  (2, 4)

```

Shortcomings of this evaluation approach include the fact that it is not able to account for the case where the generated fingering is plausible but is not represented by one of the supplied reference fingerings. However, it is sufficient here to show that the generated fingering is quite plausible, since it matches very closely to the reference fingering, which we know to be plausible. We are pleased that the algorithm produces good results for relatively simple scores.

We now shown the results of the algorithm on another score, an excerpt from the hymn tune “Lobe den Herren,” which is more complex than the last example.

```

```

Clearly, the generated fingering is not as successful as in the previous example, although it matches well near the start and the end. The problems that occur in the middle of the generated fingering highlight some of the problems with the algorithm and areas for improvement.

### Issues

In the second example, the generated fingering calls for a transition of (1, 4) (assigned to D4 and B4) to (3, 5) (assigned to F#4 and A4), which demonstrates one of the main problems with the algorithm. This transition calls for finger 5 to cross under finger 4 to a lower note, and indeed, this is a valid fingering transition in many cases. However, in this case, this transition is actually impractical or impossible because of the mediating effect of finger 1 in the first of the two fingering states. That is, finger 5 is able to cross under finger 4 when the rest of the fingers are relaxed with respect to fingers 4 and 5, but the crossing is not possible when there is tension resulting from another span, as is the case with finger 1 in this instance. Thus, we see that limitations of the model result from the assumption that the costs of pair assignments are independent of other pair assignments, when in reality they are not always independent. In order to improve the model, we would like to devise a system that takes into account more than two fingers at a time in order to determine cost.

Another significant issue is the calculation of horizontal cost for transitions to substitution fingering states. Currently, our simplistic system of horizontal cost calculations does not consider pairs where the note from the first and second fingering states is the same. This is reasonable for normal fingering state transitions because such pairs simply represent a repeated note, but it is less than ideal for substitution transitions. Although substitution transitions involve the same note in the first and second fingering states, the assigned finger changes, and thus we would like a pair cost to be calculated rather than having the pair be removed from consideration. Currently we compensate for this shortcoming by providing a constant substitution cost as described earlier, but a more sophisticated system for calculating horizontal costs would enable more accurate decisions about whether or not to use substitution for a given score state.

Other potential improvements to the algorithm include representing the differences between white and black keys, as well as representing spans using distances that exactly reflect physical distances. That is, the current usage of semitones as a unit is only an approximation because physical distance of a semitone on the keyboard is not the same for all semitones. For example, the physical distance between C and C# is less than the physical distance between E and F, even though both spans are 1 semitone.

Finally, we would like to enhance the algorithm to generate multiple fingerings in the case that there are multiple paths in the graph that have the least cost. This would allow us to obtain multiple fingerings that are equally plausible. In addition, if one of the generated fingerings is noticeably better than the others, we can look for ways to improve the model by encoding the preference back into it, such that the updated algorithm would output only the preferred fingering when run on the same input score.

### Conclusion

Based on the results of this research, we feel confident that automatic generation of legato organ fingerings has the potential to produce accurate and useful results. We have identified several issues with the current algorithm and suggestions on how to improve it in order to work toward reaching this goal. Even if an improved system occasionally encounters problems on complex scores, we anticipate that use of the system with human post-editing can save time in producing fingerings for organ scores, as well as assist in finding plausible fingerings that may not be immediately apparent.
