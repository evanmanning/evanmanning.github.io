# Evan Manning

I'm a software engineer with 4+ years of industry experience, focused on full ownership of back-end service and microservice development: design, implementation, automated testing, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance.

I've worked primarily with technologies in the Java ecosystem, but I also love others like Python, and I love learning.

I have work experience in Japanese-to-English translation, and I have substantial living experience in Japan, including as an exchange student at a Japanese high school for an academic year.
