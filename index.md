# Evan Manning

I'm a software engineer with 4 years of industry experience. I've worked primarily with technologies in the Java ecosystem, but I've also enjoyed doing projects using languages like Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS, and I'm eager to learn and grow.

I also have experience in JA>EN translation, and I have substantial living experience in Japan, including as an exchange student at a Japanese high school for an academic year.
